# Tic Tac Toe (Qt C++ with Move Evaluation Bot)

**Tic Tac Toe** is a desktop implementation of the classic 3x3 grid game, built using **Qt C++**. It features a bot opponent that evaluates **all possible future moves** (full game tree traversal) to determine its next action. The bot's behavior can be adjusted by setting a **difficulty level**, which defines the **probability** of it choosing the best possible move.
